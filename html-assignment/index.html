                    Hello, My name is <em>Shuntian Li</em>, my English name is <b>THOR</b> cause I love Norse Mythology wile I was a kid, some friend call me <b>Thunder</b> cause of this. I am now in the 1<sup>th</sup> semester of interactive media design program. I was born in China in 1995. I lived in Quebec for 3 years wile I was 15. I like Canada very much, so I decided to return to Canada to study again in the future, hoping to master French during my time in Canada, so that I can master four different languages which are Chinese, Japanese, English and French at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like movies and music very much, so in the future, I want to have my own studio and complete some works with my friends and have our own website as well. I do not have any long-term work experience, but I did a lot of part-time jobs wile studying. I have helped magazines interpret articles, help restaurants draw murals, design logos for companies, etc. My favorite saying is <b>The ones who travels far knows more</b> (Qichang, 1555), which keeps me always curious with everything and lean new skills.
